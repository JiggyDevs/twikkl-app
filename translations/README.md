# Localization

## dependencies

- i18next
- react-i18next

## Structure

`./translations/` contains the main configuration file for i18next

`./transaltions/resources` contains files for each language supported

Official setup guide shows translations in one file but we have separated them into multiple files for better readability and maintainability.

## Improvements

- creating type for translation keys so that all files can be checked for consistency
