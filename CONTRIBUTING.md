# Welcome to TwikkL contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing! Any help you make will be reflected and shown on the repository releases ðŸ˜‰.
Please read our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community friendly, respectable and safe.

In this guide you will get an overview of the workflow from opening issue(s), creating pull request(s), reviewing, and
merging Pull Requests.

## Check issues

You can open an issue using the [issues](https://github.com/JiggyDevs/twikkl-app/issues) menu to describe the changes you'd like to see.
Or you can scan through the existing issues for something to work on.

## Check discussions

We use discussions to talk about all kinds of topics about the app or close general topics. For example: if you'd
like to show a bad practice in code, fix a mistake in README file, or want to share something amazing you've learned,
join us in the discussions ðŸ˜‰.

## Pull requests

Collaborators can create, take, update issues by themselves. Once an issue is done they can do Pull request within the repository.

Even if you are not a collaborator you have the right to **fork** the repository and send your PR (pull request(s)).
Please check the GitHub ["Creating a pull request from a fork" guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).

## Releases

We are still in early stage of the app, we have some time to learn from mistakes and challenges. So we think to keep working
to show up the app with its features first. If so, we may certainly move to produce releases with CI/CD pipelines and more.

## Thank you

That's how you can easily become a member of the TwikkL community.

Thanks for all your contributions and efforts towards improving this project.

We thank you for being part of our community!
