# Welcome to TwikkL contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing! Any help you make will be reflected and shown on the repository releases ðŸ˜‰.
Please read our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community friendly, respectable and safe.

In this guide you will get an overview of the workflow from opening issue(s), creating pull request(s), reviewing, and
merging Pull Requests.

## Check issues
You can open an issue using the [issues](https://github.com/JiggyDevs/twikkl-app/issues) menu to describe the changes you'd like to see.
Or you can look through the existing issues for something to work on.

## Check discussions
We use discussions to talk about all kinds of topics about the app or general ideas. For example: if you'd
like to show a bad practice in code, fix a mistake in README file, or want to share something amazing you've learned,
join us in the discussions ðŸ˜‰.

## How to deal with code?
Once you have the app installed on your own machine, keep your code clean with support of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
and [ESLint-Typescript](https://typescript-eslint.io/). We have sat up a complete configuration for these in the source files of the project. Please respect the rules 
and do NOT change anything unless there is really a good reason.

If you have issues to format the code within your IDE, feel free to ask for help in discussions.

## Pull requests
Collaborators can create, take, update issues by themselves. Once an issue is done they can do PRs ( Pull Requests) within the repository.

Even if you are not a collaborator you have the right to **fork** the repository and send your PR and becomes contributor!
Please check the GitHub ["Creating a pull request from a fork" guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).

## Releases
We are still in early stage of the app, we have some time to learn from mistakes and challenges. So we think to keep working
to show up the app with its features first. If so, we may certainly move to produce releases with CI/CD pipelines and more.

## Thank you
That's how you can easily become a member of the TwikkL community.

Thanks for all your contributions and efforts towards improving this project.

We thank you for being part of our community!
