## Intro

Welcome ! This is the place to get started with **TwikkL** app. We introduce you to the very interesting topics and
aspects. Also, we give support to mobile dev community to learn.

This app is intended to be a cross-platform
[_DApp_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp)
(for Android and iOS), that makes live-streaming, record, share videos and provide services.

NOTE:  
If you are an experienced person and want to give us your support or point of view or if you are a beginner who would
like to ask some questions feel free to contact us in [Discussions](https://github.com/JiggyDevs/twikkl-app/discussions)
.

## Demo

This following demo animated image, represents the actual version of the app. Yes, it's still new ü§£

</details>

## Getting started

Before you start make sure that you have at least ~15 minutes ‚è± to set up your dev environment.

The most important techs used are :

1. React v18
2. React Native v0.71
3. Expo v48 (Managed)
4. React Native Paper v5 (UI library)

NOTE:  
Don't worry if you don't know few of these, it's fine üòÖ. But if you are totally new to these, then we recommend you to
learn some basics. If so, we suggest you to follow
the [React Native basics guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

Next, make sure to install the following tools on your local machine and Os:

1. Node.js (We recommend [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/) higher than v16 )
2. A JavaScript IDE such as VsCode, Webstorm etc...
3. Git (visit [the GitHub's guide on how to set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git))

You can run the app directly on your own device by using [Expo Go App](https://expo.dev/client) (available on Android
and iOS), it makes you run the app directly on a physical device ü§©.

If you want to use emulator or iOS simulator, we recommend you to visit the following links:

- [Android emulator setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

If you want to run the app on web navigator like Chrome or Mozilla, then you'll have
to [add few additional dependencies](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/).

## Deploy locally

Once you're ready with the tools mentioned above, you can import source code using _Git CLI_ with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/JiggyDevs/twikkl-app.git
```

2. Next, install the app using npm:`npm install`.

3. run the following command from the project root directory:

```
npx expo start
```

NOTE:  
If you're looking to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) then you have to delete the [package-lock.json](package-lock.json)
file just after the clone. Use `yarn install` to install dependencies.

## Navigation

We use [expo-router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) as a small framework to manage routing.
All screens are defined under [/app](/app) folder (based on the official guide). Currently, there are few pages to test
the navigation.

We think that navigation business logic can become much better when we pass to state management.

## Styling

The styling integration must follow the design prototype, which is currently exposed as few images under [/docs](https://github.com/JiggyDevs/twikkl-app/tree/set-guidelines-and-docs/docs/design-imgs) folder.

The styling integration must follow the design prototype, which is currently exposed as few examples
under [/docs](/docs/design-imgs) folder.

If you are interested in watching all examples (the design roadmap), we invite you to use
our [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/TtG5t7l8EQIA4BwfFMRAAI/TwikkL?node-id=418%3A36&t=rxx6eB7V3se1yrOr-1)
üòâ, just create a free account, and you're done.

Also, notice the theme setup in [theme.ts](/src/configs/theme.ts) file, this configuration is made
following [React Native Paper theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/theming/).

Finally, as for the icons, following the [Expo icons guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/) we
use [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) tool to generate our own icon-set.

## Contributing

Please see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for detailed instructions on how to get started with us. We accept
any sort of help that can make this project better, even a word like "Good luck!" üòç.
